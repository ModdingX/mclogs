# mclogs

This repository contains the data for the gist at https://git.io/mclogs

It is a document that explains to users why minecraft logs are important when they have a problem and how to send it.
This repository exists to allow for contributions to the mclogs gist.

### How to contribute

You can contribute in two ways:
- By making *content changes* to keep mclogs up to date with developments in the minecraft ecosystem.
- By *translating* the document into other languages or help keeping existing translations up to date.

*Content changes* change the content of the gist.
This can for example mean adding another paste site to the list or add instructions for another launcher.
See the [issues](https://github.com/ModdingX/mclogs/issues) tab to see what is currently missing in mclogs.
If you'd like to open a pull request you only need to target the english version found in `_mc-logs.md`.
If you can add your changes to other languages as well, that would be great.
However it is not a requirement.

*Translations* translate the english version into other languages.
In general any language is acceptable if it is actually spoken somewhere in the world (so no pirate speak).
Also, already translated versions will need to be updated to reflect changes made in the english version.
For more information on how to contribute a translation and a list of outdated translations, see [#13](https://github.com/ModdingX/mclogs/issues/13).
