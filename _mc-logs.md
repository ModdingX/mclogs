# Minecraft Logs

If you've a problem with minecraft and you want help from others, you need to send you minecraft log.
The log contains information and detailed error messages that help finding out what the error is.

## How can I upload the log?

There is a variety of websites where it's possible to upload log files.
You'll then get a link you can post in a help channel.
**Never** send the log as one long message.

  * [https://hastebin.com](https://hastebin.com)
  * [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
  * And many more.
  
## How to I find the log?

Before uploading the log, you should stop the game if it did not crash.

### MultiMC

If you're using MultiMC, click on `Edit Instance`, then on `Other logs`.
Now choose `logs/latest.log` in the selector at the top and click on `Upload`.
You'll get a link that you can post.
Alternatively you can directly press `Upload` in the `Minecraft Log` tab.

### Other Launchers

*Hey you should think about switching to [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/).
It makes many things related to minecraft much easier and you can also easily install ModPacks from CurseForge.*

In you `.minecraft` folder, you'll find a folder named `logs`.
Inside that there's a file called `latest.log`.
You need to upload that file to one of the websites linked above.

### Important

    However, if you've problems finding the log, don't hesitate to ask for help.
  * **If you post your log as a long message into chat, you shouldn't expect any help.**
  * **The LOG is not the same as the CRASH REPORT. Please read the instructions above.**
